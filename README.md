# Project description

This project outlines a full digital transformation strategy for CitySprouts, a local agriculture social enterprise. It includes a Figma prototype for a platform application as well as a AI/ML component that explores the use of creating a CNN with Keras to identify plant diseases according to its leaf condition.

Unfortunately, as the project is too big to be hosted fully on Github, here are links to each component.
